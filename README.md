# MNIST-digit-recognizer

Featuring engineering for making tree ensemble methods Like Extreme Gradient Boosting competitive with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on classification tasks.

Some detailing about the Project here:

## Dataset: MNIST digit reognizer

## Sequential CNN Architechture:

Input -> [[Conv2D->ReLu]*2 -> MaxPool2D -> Dropout]*2 -> Flatten -> Dense -> Dropout -> Output

loss='categorical_crossentropy'

optimizer='adadelta'

metrics=['accuracy']

# Overall accuracy of 98.50% is achieved using Xgb to classify handwritten digits from 0 - 9.
